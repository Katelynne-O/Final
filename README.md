Video Demo : 
Description: 
This Python Script is a simple Expense Tracker in which user can log their expenses and analyze them. Users input the name of an expense, amount, and choose a category e.g. Food, Home, Fun, Misc. This program stores these up expenses as CSV (expenses. csv) and generates a summary with spending by category, total cost, remaining budget, and recommended daily budget given the number of days remaining until the end of the month. It performs input validation, works well about file operations, and provides simple funds tracking features. It is used to track customers spendings and keep a budget.
